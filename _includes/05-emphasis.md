*I am in the military, I am really looking forward to getting out. I have been in the Military for about 5 years now. I am **22 years old** and i look forward to the next chapter of my life. the military is not a healthy and if I have taken anything away from the military it is that it is over funded and that you as an individual do not matter unless you have a whole lot of rank. I have grown up a little bit faster than some of the people I know that are not in the military and for that I am thankful, but it's not a healthy environment and don't encourage people to join the **Army**.*
